Web server URL scheme:

*) All URLs begin with "/vm"

*) Static content (css, js, images) are in "/vm/www"

*) Any URL that does not map to a file on disk is passed to the handler for "/vm"

*) Individual VM mgmt is via: "/vm/$verb/$uuid"
   No verb means main interface.

Perl notes:

Every source file must be in a unique "package".  If they share package names,
they cannot share globals unless references to those globals are explicitely scoped
with "::".
This is _EXACTLY_ what was happening to me:

    "While this might not match my articulation thus far, it matches the behavior my brain 
    is currently expecting. My one problem is this: if you use strict but have two files that 
    declare variables in the same package, you can't easily access variables from file two when 
    they.re declared in file one. I guess it just seems fucked up. With use warnings in effect 
    you can't even use the fully-qualified name without getting some complaints. Moral of the 
    story: use package statements for every file that you're going to want to access members of later."
